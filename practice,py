# You're a home decorator, and you'd like to use Python to streamline some of your work. 
# Specifically, you're creating a tool that you intend to use to calculate the cost of painting a room.

# As a first step, define a function get_cost() that takes as input:

# sqft_walls = total square feet of walls to be painted
# sqft_ceiling = square feet of ceiling to be painted
# sqft_per_gallon = number of square feet that you can cover with one gallon of paint
# cost_per_gallon = cost (in dollars) of one gallon of paint
# It should return the cost (in dollars) of putting one coat of paint on all walls and the ceiling. 
# Assume you can buy the exact amount of paint that you need, so you can buy partial gallons 
def get_cost(sqft_walls, sqft_ceiling, sqft_per_gallon, cost_per_gallon):
    area = sqft_ceiling+sqft_walls
    d = area/sqft_per_gallon
    cost = d*cost_per_gallon
    return cost
print(get_cost(432, 144, 400, 15))



# Now say you can no longer buy fractions of a gallon. (For instance, 
# if you need 4.3 gallons to do a project, then you have to buy 5 gallons of paint.)

# With this new scenario, you will create a new function get_actual_cost that uses the same inputs and calculates the cost of your project.
